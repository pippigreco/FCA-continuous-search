# FCA Continuous Search

This project is a JavaScript-based program to illustrate an interface that could help users to understand their preferences on objects given preferences on attributes.

Users specify their preferences on the attributes (three attributes in the implemented example) and then can create ("Search") a ranked list of objects, each object being identified with the set (list) of attributes it satisfies.
